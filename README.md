# Sainsburys-coupon-fraud

Recently I have come across multiple servers expoiting you coupon system. These servers exploit your weak coupon system to leverage thousands on pounds of free food, giftcards and whatever else they can find.

Some of the servers are reaching member counts of 4,000. Thousands a day they are costing you. So how does it work?

They make a simple ean-13 coupon e.g 930026389509 ( A Â£9.50 coupon ) 
The problem is that the coupons work on anything and are resuable ( even in the same transaction )
Recently they have started rolling out pyhsical coupons which use the same paper as your coupons, same printer and same ink.
